    text: `At Bright Sand, our name is more than just a label; it is a testament to a legacy of perseverance and vision. Rooted in a journey that began in 1911, the spirit of our forebears shapes the core of our identity and purpose.\n\nOur story traces back to a courageous venture when my grandfather, with a wagon and horses, embarked on a formidable trek through the Dakotas, ultimately settling in a quaint town in northern Saskatchewan. It was here, in Bright Sand, Saskatchewan, where my mother came into the world in 1929, planting the seeds of our future. This lineage and the tales of resilience deeply influenced the birth of our venture in 2014, when I established a sole proprietorship aptly named Bright Sand.`,

    text: `Bright Sand transitioned from a humble beginning into a beacon of innovation and commitment. In 2014, we laid our foundation as a sole proprietorship, a nod to our familial roots and a testament to our dedication. The ensuing years marked our expansion and incorporation, first with Bright Sand Canada in Windsor, Ontario, in 2020, and soon after, Bright Sand Inc. in Chattanooga, TN. In 2023, we further solidified our presence by establishing Bright Sand Industries in Detroit, Michigan. Each step on this journey was not just a growth in our footprint but a reaffirmation of our commitment to making a tangible impact.`,
