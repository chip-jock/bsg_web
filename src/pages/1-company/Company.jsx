              Historical Journey
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black font-roboto">
              Our story traces back to a courageous venture when my
              grandfather, with a wagon and horses, embarked on a
              formidable trek through the Dakotas, ultimately settling
              in a quaint town in northern Saskatchewan. It was here,
              in Bright Sand, Saskatchewan, where my mother came into
              the world in 1929, planting the seeds of our future.
              This lineage and the tales of resilience deeply
              influenced the birth of our venture in 2014, when I
              established a sole proprietorship aptly named Bright
              Sand. The choice was deliberate, symbolizing the
              pioneering spirit and tenacity that not only brought me
              into existence but also fuels our company's ethos.

              Company Evolution
            </h2>
            <p className="text-black font-roboto">
              Bright Sand transitioned from a humble beginning into a
              beacon of innovation and commitment. In 2014, we laid
              our foundation as a sole proprietorship, a nod to our
              familial roots and a testament to our dedication. The
              ensuing years marked our expansion and incorporation,
              first with Bright Sand Canada in Windsor, Ontario, in
              2020, and soon after, Bright Sand Inc. in Chattanooga,
              TN. In 2023, we further solidified our presence by
              establishing Bright Sand Industries in Detroit,
              Michigan. Each step on this journey was not just a
              growth in our footprint but a reaffirmation of our
              commitment to making a tangible impact.
